# Features

## <u>Commands</u>
### /sign
With this command you can sign an item instantly. The lore will be determined by the content under `SHORT` inside of the `config.yml`.<p></p>
<u>Here is a list of all arguments for `/sign`:</u>
* `/sign help`  â†’  will show you a list of all commands.
* `/sign <text>`  â†’  creates a signature with a custom text, depending on the `DEFAULT` content
* `/sign delete`  â†’  removes an applied signature
* `/sign lock`  â†’  will lock an item to prevent adding a signature with `/sign` or `/sign <text>`
* `/sign unlock`  â†’  will free an item from it's locked state and allows signatures again
* `/sign version`  â†’  shows you some version information
<u>**Example:**</u>
```
/sign <yellow>That item is so <gold>awesome<yellow> and <gold>rare<yellow>,<br>that every player wants to own.
```
### /rename
With the command `/rename <text>` you can change an items displayname. It uses color formats and placeholders here too!<p></p>
<u>**Example:**</u>
```
/rename This is a <aqua>cool<reset> item name!
```
## <u>Formatting</u>
All messages within the configuration and language files support **MiniMessage**. To learn how to use it, please visit the [Adventure](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) website.<p></p>
I highly recommend using the **MiniMessage** format, as it is also the current best practice for all users of Paper and it's derivatives.
Legacy formats such as  `&`  or  `&#rrggbb`  will *kinda work* too, but are <u>**not**</u> recommended!<p></p>
You can also use all placeholders from the **PlaceholderAPI** and it's expansions!
## <u>Language Files</u>
**RHSignItem** ships with some default language files: German, English and Russian. You can change these as you desire.
But you can also create a new file and integrate it.
In this case, make sure to properly set the `locale` to the files name in the config.
## <u>Auto-Locking</u>
In order to make the signing process as easy as possible, you can enable the `auto-lock` setting. After that, every new signature will automatically set the locked state onto the item.<p></p>
If you want to specify that feature, while only allowing players with the correct permission to do that, activate it through the `permission-based` setting. Players will need the `rhsignitem.command.sign.lock.auto` permission.
## <u>Optional Offhand Requirements</u>
With the `offhand-item-mode` setting you can choose, if the player needs to hold an item in his offhand in order to create a signature with `/sign` or `/sign <text>`.<p></p>
`type` determines the item that is needed.<p></p>
Also you can choose, if the item should be used.
* durability -1
* amount -1
## <u>Item Blacklist</u>
As a server owner or administrator, you probably don't want all items to be allowed for signatures. **RHSignItem** comes with a blacklist feature, that can easily be configured and extented.
## <u>Vault integration</u>
If you want to make the commands only usable through a payment, just toggle it's setting inside the `config.yml` file!
You can set a fixed price for executing any command, toggle each command and choose, which ones should be set behind a paywall.
Also you can toggle messages when using the payment system.
